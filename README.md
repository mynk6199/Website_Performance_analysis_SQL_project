# WEBSITE ANALYSIS PROJECT
# MavenFuzzyFactory Data Analysis Project
## Introduction
This repository contains the code and queries used to analyze the data of the MavenFuzzyFactory website. The analysis focuses on understanding website traffic, performance, and key business metrics using MySQL server. The data is extracted from the mavenfuzzyfactory database.

## Functions To Analyse Data
 SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY
 GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions
including COUNT, COUNT(DISTINCT), MIN, MAX, AVG, and SUM
Count And Case to Pivoting Data
Joining multiple tables with INNER JOIN, 
LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN
Used Date Functions Like Year, Month, Week, Date
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE And Subqueries
## Instructions
To replicate the analysis or explore the data further, follow the steps outlined below:

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have MySQL installed on your system.
Create a database named mavenfuzzyfactory and import the necessary data.

## Project Structure
